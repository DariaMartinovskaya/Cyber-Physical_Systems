## Project description

The goal of the project was to develop a motion monitoring system using the ESP32 microcontroller. 

- It focuses on collecting data after the ride, not providing feedback while riding. 
- The system uses an MPU6050 sensor to measure acceleration, tilt, and rotation. 
- The ESP32 processes this data and sends it via WiFi. 
- Finally, the data is stored on a server for later analysis.
